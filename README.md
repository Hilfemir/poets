Parallel Odd-Even Transposition Sort implemented in C++ using MPI.

## Usage
Run the `test.sh <count>` script to test the program. The script takes one parameter `count` denoting how many numbers will be randomly generated as the input sequence and also how many child processes will MPI use (each process will recieve its own number to work with).
